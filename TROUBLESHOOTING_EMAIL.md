# 📧 Email Not Received - Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ Current Status
- Backend API: **WORKING** ✅
- Resend Integration: **CONFIGURED** ✅
- API Response: **200 OK - Email sent successfully** ✅

## 🔍 Why You Might Not Be Receiving Emails

### 1. **Check Spam/Junk Folder** ⚠️
Emails from `onboarding@resend.dev` often go to spam initially.

**Action:**
- Open Gmail: https://mail.google.com
- Login with: `idavazhikal123@gmail.com`
- Check **Spam** and **Junk** folders
- Look for emails from "Portfolio Contact"

---

### 2. **Verify Resend Dashboard** 📊
Check if Resend is actually sending the emails.

**Action:**
1. Go to: https://resend.com/emails
2. Login to your Resend account
3. Check the **Emails** tab
4. Look for recent sends - you should see:
   - **Status**: Sent/Delivered/Bounced
   - **To**: idavazhikal123@gmail.com
   - **Subject**: Portfolio Contact: Message from...

**What to Look For:**
- ✅ **Sent** - Email left Resend
- ✅ **Delivered** - Email reached Gmail
- ❌ **Bounced** - Email was rejected
- ❌ **Failed** - Something went wrong

---

### 3. **Test with a Different Email** 🧪
Since Resend free tier only allows sending to your verified email, let's make sure it's configured correctly.

**Current Configuration:**
```javascript
to: ['idavazhikal123@gmail.com']
```

**Verify in Resend:**
1. Go to: https://resend.com/settings
2. Check **Verified Email**: Should show `idavazhikal123@gmail.com`
3. Status should be **Verified** ✅

---

### 4. **Check Environment Variables on Render** 🔧
Make sure `RESEND_API_KEY` is set correctly on Render.

**Action:**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select your backend service
3. Go to **Environment** tab
4. Verify:
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` is present
   - Value starts with `re_`
   - No extra spaces or quotes

---

### 5. **Test Backend Locally** 💻
Test if the email works when running locally.

**Steps:**
```bash
cd d:\Protfolio\protfolio-2\backend
npm start
```

Then test the form on `localhost:5000`

---

## 🚀 Quick Test Command

Run this to send a test email:
```bash
cd d:\Protfolio\protfolio-2
node test-contact.js
```

Then check:
1. **Inbox** of idavazhikal123@gmail.com
2. **Spam folder**
3. **Resend dashboard**: https://resend.com/emails

## 🔧 If Still Not Working

### Option 1: Enable Gmail Filtering
Add `onboarding@resend.dev` to your Gmail contacts to prevent spam filtering.

### Option 2: Verify a Custom Domain (Recommended)
For production use, verify your own domain:
1. Go to: https://resend.com/domains
2. Add your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
3. Add DNS records as instructed
4. Update `from` address in `server.js`:
   ```javascript
   from: 'Portfolio Contact <contact@yourdomain.com>'
   ```

### Option 3: Use Alternative Email Service
If Resend doesn't work for your use case:
- **SendGrid** (100 emails/day free)
- **Mailgun** (5,000 emails/month free)
- **Amazon SES** (62,000 emails/month free with AWS)

## 📝 Expected Email Format

When it works, you should receive an email like this:

**Subject:** Portfolio Contact: Message from [Name]

**From:** Portfolio Contact <onboarding@resend.dev>

**Reply-To:** [Visitor's Email]

**Body:**
```
New Contact Form Submission

Name: [Visitor Name]
Email: [Visitor Email]
Message:

Reply directly to this email to respond to [Name].
```
